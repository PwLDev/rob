# 🥫 Rob
A fun bot for your Discord server that can join the conversation!
Just ping him with a message, and he'll respond back just as if he was another one of yours! 
Share opinions, laugh together, and level up your server with a bot that can talk, send/get custom letters to/from your trusted servers, and automatically get the chat back on track when it's inactive!

# Setup guide
1. Invite Rob to your server.
2. Create the `• RobAdmin` role and assign it to yourself and other people you want changing Rob's settings.
3. Take a moment to use the `#!option <option> <value>` command to change Rob's settings to your liking. Available options and what they do:
    - `randomlyMessage` (values: **enable/disable**) -- Allows the bot to send an unprompted message at a random time when the chat is inactive. - Default is **disable**
    - `responseFrequency` (values: **a number from 1-100**, default **4**) -- Controls the chances of Rob responding to a message without being pinged to do so (a higher number means more often, recommended values are 0-4 if your server isn't Rob-centric) - Default is **4**
    - `listen` (values: **enable/disable**) -- Turns the bot on when enabled or off when disabled. - Default is **enable**
    - `model` (values: **available model names on [groqcloud](https://console.groq.com/docs/models)**) -- Change the AI model Rob uses in your server for responses. - Default is **llama-3.1-8b-instant**
    - `dumb` (values: **enable/disable**) -- Controls whether to generate messages locally instead of using groqcloud's API, which may produce less coherent responses and may not use a full-fat AI model all the time. **This is currently an UNSTABLE feature as it may make the bot faster, slower, or not work at all.** - Default is **disable**
    - `mailChannel` (values: **channel name starting with #**) -- Sets the channel to use for receiving letters from other servers. - Auto-detects your general channel by default.
4. Send your first message to Rob by @mentioning him!
